## Abstract 

Generative Adversarial Networks are one of the most recent powerful machine learning models that generate initiating realistic data from a given data set. Generative adversarial networks were initially designed and introduced by Ian Goodfellow in June 2014. They are simply neural networks class of machine learning frameworks. They were presented with the intention of overcoming the data availability issues that arise with deep neural networks DNNs. DNNs have been used widely among various domains and applications. These networks rely heavily on massive sets of labeled training data which is either unavailable or costly to obtain. \

GANs provide the possibility of developing and generating richer data sets with training on very small labeled data sets.  GANs achieve a high level of realism in generating realistic data sets by combining two neural network models. A generative model that attempts to create realistic data sets by being trained on given labeled data sets, and a discriminator model that determines if the output data is synthetic or belongs to the given training data.

## Purpose

Our final project is a fully back-end based application that takes in a dataset as an input and returns
a generated artwork as an output. The application supports a variety of themes which are listed as
the following:

- Demons
- Hell
- Psychedelic
- Purgatory
- Dark
- Depression
- All of the themes together
- 
The application takes user input for the theme selection as well as for the desired output size, as our
application supports two sizes which are:

- One picture
- A 7 x 7 collection of pictures

The application then uses the corresponding NPY file as training dataset as an input and generates
artwork as an output. 

## Technologies

The GAN neural network was built using Python and utilized the Tensorflow library for constructing and building the discriminator and generator neural networks.
